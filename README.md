PROJECT PORTFOLIO – ZENG Wai Ming
Application No. 52600001924

This repository contains three independent projects that demonstrate my proficiency in C++ programming, data structures, modern C++ features, and GUI development. They are part of my ongoing efforts to strengthen my software development skills beyond coursework.

---

PROJECT 1: BigInt – Arbitrary-Precision Arithmetic Using Linked List
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Description:
Unlike conventional implementations that rely on arrays, strings, or vectors to simulate high‑precision arithmetic, this project implements a doubly linked circular list to store digits of arbitrarily large integers and decimals. Each node holds a single digit, and the list structure allows natural propagation of carries/borrows during addition and subtraction. The implementation includes:

- Full support for addition and subtraction of integers and decimals.
- Capacity to handle multiple input.
- Manual memory management following the Rule of Three (destructor, copy constructor, copy assignment operator).
- Sign handling and alignment of decimal points.

Key learning outcomes:
- Deep understanding of pointer manipulation and dynamic memory.
- Experience with linked list traversal, insertion, and deletion.
- Ability to design a non‑trivial class with proper resource management.

PROJECT 2: Stanford CS106L Assignments (C++ Modern Features)
-------------------------------------------------------------
This project comprises three assignments from the Stanford CS106L course, focusing on modern C++ and real‑world application design.

Assignment 2.1: Course Scheduler
- Reads a list of courses from an input file, filters them based on user‑specified availability, and outputs the available and unavailable courses into separate files.
- Practices: file I/O, container usage (std::vector, std::string).

Assignment 2.2: Best Match
- Implements a matching algorithm that finds the best match for a query among a set of entries based on field‑wise comparison.
- Practices: STL algorithms (std::sort, std::find_if), custom comparators, and string manipulation.

Assignment 2.3: Custom Class Design
- Designs a custom class (e.g., a Student or Course class) with proper encapsulation, constructors, and operator overloading.
- Practices: object‑oriented design, inheritance (if applicable), and RAII principles.

Key learning outcomes:
- Mastery of C++ standard library containers and algorithms.
- Experience with file processing and text parsing.
- Solid understanding of class design, rule of five, and modern C++ idioms (auto, range‑based for, etc.).

PROJECT 3: ToDo List Application (Qt GUI)
------------------------------------------
A feature‑rich ToDo list application. Currently supports:

- Add, delete, and view tasks.
- Sort tasks by priority and date.
- Edit task status: date, importance, dependence, for instance.
- Planned enhancements: file persistence (save/load tasks), filtering by category, search functionality and  Qt-built GUI.

This ongoing project expectedly demonstrates my ability to work with a professional GUI framework and design user‑friendly interfaces.

Key learning outcomes:
- Event‑driven programming and signal‑slot mechanism.
- Model‑View architecture in Qt.
- Integration of C++ logic with graphical components.
